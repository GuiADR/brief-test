# Desafio Brief

## ðŸ›  Getting started

- You must first clone the repository using your terminal
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/GuiADR/brief-test
```
 -  or download the zip from the green button at the beginning of the repository

- Then you must navigate through the terminal into the repository folder and install the dependencies through the composer
```zsh
cd path_folder
$path_folder composer install
```

- If you have already cloned the repository in the wordpress plug-ins folder, all you need to do now is activate the plug-in, otherwise copy the folder to the wordpress plug-ins folder or create a zip (now with dependencies ) and install in the wordpress admin panel
